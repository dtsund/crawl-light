# When making this on MinGW, the 'scripts' (not really scripts at all, just C++
# programs that *should* rightly be scripts) that generate the .cc and .h files
# for tile definitons just don't work.  Therefore, these files need to be
# packaged in the tarball.  Since make clean nukes them, we have to regenerate
# them before packaging.
